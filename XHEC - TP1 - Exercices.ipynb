    "#### Specifics:\n",
    "1. **Analyze the Data Preprocessing Function**:\n",
    "   - Understand how this function preprocesses individual datasets. Focus on its parameters and the transformations it applies, such as grouping, resampling, and interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Examine the Data Loading Functions**:\n",
    "   - Describe how these functions load energy consumption and weather data. Discuss the steps involved in preprocessing this data.\n",
